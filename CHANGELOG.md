Follows semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

## [v5.3.0] – 2026-08-30

### Added

- **Interactive Code Editor Selection (`setup_editor`)**: Multi-choice selection in `dev` and `full` profiles offering Zed (Recommended), VS Codium, Anti gravity IDE, VS Code (Not recommended), and an option to skip, complete with tailored configuration deployment
- **Interactive Zed Runner (`~/.local/bin/zed-run`)**: Universal multi-language execution script (Python, Rust, C, C++, Go, JS, TS, Bash, Lua, HTML) featuring a `Ctrl+C` interrupt trap (`INT`/`TERM`) that smoothly drops to an interactive ZSH subshell
- **Ruff Python Tooling**: Added `ruff` (extreme performance Python linter and formatter) directly to essential DNF development packages
- **PostgreSQL 18 & pgAdmin 4**: Added official PGDG RPM repository (`pgdg-fedora-repo`), automated `postgresql18-server` install, cluster `initdb`, systemd activation, environment PATH (`/etc/profile.d/pgsql18.sh`), and `pgadmin4-desktop` via official pgAdmin repository
- **Kitty Terminal Suite**: Integrated Kitty terminal configuration with translucent dark glass aesthetics (font size 13, opacity 0.90, blur 50, top tab bar navigation)
- **WirePlumber Bluetooth HD Audio**: Deployed configuration for high-resolution Bluetooth codecs (LDAC, AptX, AAC) with automatic profile switching
- **Desktop & Creator Utilities**: Integrated Stirling-PDF offline utility suite, GSConnect firewall rules, and NVIDIA Broadcast AI noise reduction for creator setups
- **Modern CLI Tools**: Added `duf`, `sassc`, `wl-clipboard`, `qbittorrent`, `ntfs-3g`, `gparted`, and `timeshift` to package installation

### Changed

- Updated profile matrices (`dev` and `full`) and execution sequence to replace legacy editor steps with `setup_editor`
- Configured DNF with `defaultyes=True` for streamlined package transactions
- Standardized Zed installation on the official installer script (`https://zed.dev/install.sh`) without third-party repository dependencies

### Security

- Hardened `.gitignore` with defensive patterns against committing environment files (`.env*`), SSH/GPG keys, and secret credential bundles

---

## [v5.2.0] – 2026-08-18

### Changed

- Replaced Oh My Zsh and Powerlevel10k with Starship prompt (`starship`) and standalone ZSH plugins (`zsh-autosuggestions`, `zsh-syntax-highlighting`), deploying a pre-configured `~/.config/starship.toml` and clean `.zshrc`
- Enabled DNS configuration (`setup_dns`) across all profiles (`minimal`, `dev`, `gaming`, `workstation`, `creator`, `full`) with an informational banner explaining benefits and network considerations (default: Cloudflare 1.1.1.1, option 2: Google 8.8.8.8)
- Refactored GDM login screen no-sleep settings to write `/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/01-power` and run `dconf update`, eliminating D-Bus session and SELinux permission errors from `sudo -u gdm dbus-run-session`
- Filtered Steam and MangoHud package installation, Steam H.264 codec unlock, and `MangoHud.conf` deployment to gaming and desktop profiles (`gaming`, `workstation`, `creator`, `full`), skipping them on headless and minimal profiles
- Standardized all six profiles to uniformly include the pre-driver reboot checkpoint (`setup_pre_driver_reboot`) and GPU driver setup (`setup_drivers`) at the end of their execution flow

### Added

- Comprehensive Secure Boot and MOK enrollment guidance and disclaimer in `setup_drivers` detailing manual signing steps, `akmods` local key management, and UEFI firmware update handling
- Custom developer `.zshrc` profile with WSL Antigravity IDE (`anti`) helper, NVM integration, and history optimizations

### Removed

- Removed obsolete COPR repository for `eza` in `setup_copr()` as it is available directly in Fedora's official repositories and installed via `setup_packages()`
- Removed Cloudflare Warp step (`setup_warp`) and associated summary checks to streamline setup and avoid upstream repository instability

---

## [v5.1.0] – 2026-08-17

### Changed

- Moved GPU driver setup (`setup_drivers`) from step 8 to the final step, after all packages, tools, and services are installed and configured
- Gaming and creator profile step ordering updated to match
- Swapped awk variable passing in `set_zshrc_line` to use `ENVIRON` to prevent backslash unescaping issues on regex patterns

### Added

- `setup_pre_driver_reboot`: automatic reboot checkpoint before driver setup. Compares the running kernel against the latest installed kernel (from `dnf update`). If they differ, prompts the user to reboot first so `akmods` builds NVIDIA modules against the correct kernel. On re-run, the state file skips all completed steps and resumes at driver setup.
- Automated test suites under `tests/` covering profile step integrity, CLI options matrix, helper functions, and backup/restore subsystems (135 tests)

### Fixed

- Fixed tilde expansion issue in ZSH custom plugin clone paths by standardizing to `$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom`
- Corrected package names for Yazi in COPR setup (`ripgrep`, `fd-find`, `poppler-utils`) and added `--skip-unavailable`
- Ensured `warp-svc` service is started before attempting `warp-cli` registration
- Added `unzip` package to `setup_fonts` before font archive extraction
- Added pipefail error safeguards to `check_disk_space`, `setup_pre_driver_reboot`, and Vesktop release tag parsing
- Locally scoped GPU and chassis variables in `setup_drivers`

---

## [v5.0.3] – 2026-08-16

### Changed

- Replaced Discord with Vesktop in `setup_packages()`: Discord was previously silently skipped by `dnf` because it is not available in official Fedora repos; Vesktop is now automatically downloaded and installed via its official GitHub release `.rpm` with fallback and architecture detection
- Added `vesktop` to `show_versions()` installed package checks

---

## [v5.0.2] – 2026-08-15

### Improved

- Refactored `setup_copr()` into an array-driven loop across repositories, eliminating duplicated enable/install logic
- Streamlined step filtering and counting in `main()` into a single array pass instead of iterating twice
- Standardized command output redirections (`&>/dev/null`) and cleaned up section headers

### Removed

- Unused dead functions (`reset_state()`, redundant `cleanup()`, unused color variables)
- Inlined single-use `check_version()` logic into `show_versions()`
- Removed broken `emergency_rollback()` error trap which evaluated exit status incorrectly due to local variable scoping
- Removed redundant `validate_step()` calls

---

## [v5.0.1] – 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Progress counter no longer counts failed or skipped steps as completed — `show_summary` now reports completed/failed/skipped separately instead of one number
- `MangoHud.conf` and `.bashrc` are now backed up before being modified, matching what `restore_backups()` already expected to find
- `setup_copr` and the Antigravity install no longer swallow failures silently (`A && B || true` replaced with explicit warnings on failure)
- Antigravity CLI install in dev tools was targeting a nonexistent npm package and failing silently every time; now installs via Google's official installer (`curl -fsSL https://antigravity.google/cli/install.sh | bash`, binary `agy`)
- Steam H264 unlock now kills only the specific process it launched instead of `pkill -f "xdg-open"`, which could match unrelated processes on the system
- `.zshrc` theme/plugins lines are now set via a verified replace-or-append helper (`set_zshrc_line`) instead of relying on `sed`'s exit code, which returns 0 whether or not anything actually matched
- Disk space check now warns explicitly when it can't determine free space, instead of silently falling through to "OK" with a blank value
- Removed stale `code` version check from `show_versions` (leftover from before the switch to Antigravity); checks `agy` instead

### Changed

- Antigravity repo file still uses `gpgcheck=0` — this matches Google's own official Fedora/RHEL install instructions, which don't currently publish a signing key for the RPM repo (their APT instructions do). Rather than leave that undisclosed, the script now warns about it explicitly when the step runs.

### Docs

- README profile table now lists `multimedia` under the `gaming` profile, matching what the profile actually installs (it was already running `setup_browser_multimedia`, just not documented)

## [v5.0.0] – 2026-08-14

### Added

- Updated for Fedora 44
- Antigravity CLI in dev tools (replaces discontinued Gemini CLI)
- MangoHud config folded into the packages step (auto-configures if mangohud is present)

### Removed

- Gemini CLI is discontinued; replaced by Antigravity CLI in dev tools
- OnlyOffice step (LibreOffice ships with Fedora)
- Winboat step (too niche)
- LM Studio step (AppImage wrangling; use Ollama instead)
- MangoHud config as a standalone step (moved into packages)
- preload from COPR (negligible benefit on SSDs)
- ani-cli from COPR (too niche)
- Yaru theme prompt (Ubuntu theme on Fedora is uncommon)

### Improved

- Profiles updated to match the leaner step list
- Deduplicated gsettings calls in no-sleep setup
- Simplified Docker service management (removed redundant enable/start calls)
- ccache config no longer appends duplicate lines on re-run
- Corepack moved from Docker step to dev tools where it belongs
- Fixed `nvim` package name to `neovim`
- Simplified confirm prompt function
- Cleaned up script header

## [v4.0.0] – 2026-01-21

### Added

- KVM/QEMU virtualization module with modern socket activation (`virtqemud.socket`)
- `workstation` profile (Dev + Virtualization + Office) and `creator` profile (Gaming + Multimedia + AI)
- Rollback on failure: stops services, preserves state, points to logs
- Disk space check before starting (warns if <20GB free)
- Version pinning via `best=True` in DNF operations
- Network validation before remote operations

### Improved

- DNF config uses `best=True` and atomic RPM Fusion installation
- Better error handling with state preservation for resumption
- Modern libvirt socket activation instead of legacy service
- Documentation updated for new features and troubleshooting

### Fixed

- Progress counter in dry-run mode
- Service management during emergency rollback
- User group handling for Docker and libvirt

---

## [v3.0.0] – 2026-01-17

### Added

- Profile system: `--profile=minimal|dev|gaming|full`
- State file (`~/.config/fedora-setup/state.txt`) for idempotency
- `--force` flag to re-run completed steps
- DNS provider choice (Google, Cloudflare, or skip)
- TLP opt-in with GNOME power profiles warning
- RPM Fusion validation before multimedia step
- Dynamic step counting based on profile

### Improved

- NVIDIA Secure Boot flow: `akmods --force` + `modinfo` check before MOK enrollment
- DNF config uses `# BEGIN/END fedora-setup` block markers for clean idempotency
- More specific GPU detection patterns (VGA|3D|Display)
- Dry-run skips DNS step; progress counters only increment in real runs
- State file reset after backup restore

### Removed

- Unused `check_existing_config()` function
- `alsa-plugins-pulseaudio` (unnecessary on PipeWire)

---
